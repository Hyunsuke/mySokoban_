EPITECH PSU_MY_SOKOBAN_2022 Project

The goal was to implement the original japanese sokoban game using the ncurse library.
Usage: ./my_sokoban map

Maps should contains only :
    ¤ X: Movable blocks.
    ¤ O: The destination of the blocks.
    ¤ P: Player.
    ¤ SPACE: Empty case.
    ¤ #: Wall.

How to play :
    ¤ Key arrows : Move the player to the wanted location.
    ¤ SPACEBAR: Reset the current map.
    ¤ ECHAP : Quit the game.

You win when all the O's are replaced by X's.
You loose if you are stuck in a corner.
